Please note that there is no agreed upon cause of RSI (repetitive stress injury).  Dozens of people have blogged about their problems and their cures, or lack of.  These notes are here to facilitate your own research. Rest (most agree on rest) and consult your doctor to decide what's best for you.

Diffuse RSI - Means they can't find a medical reason

http://tiledtext.com

[[http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=421768][For RSI - Thumb or Finger Trackball?]]

http://henrikwarne.com/2012/02/18/how-i-beat-rsi/|great article with great comments

I had a bad RSI about 15 years ago with several sets of symptoms that
was not any of the tunnel syndromes. I finally got rid of it by
stopping working and going into poverty.

Before that I tried over 20 doctors, physical therapy, occupational
therapy, tie-chi, tens, stretching, exercise, rest, and all kinds of
pills. They altered the pain, but didn’t get rid of it. I probably had
several different problems, and that masked the arthritis that came on
later, until it couldn’t be hidden any more.

The state disability program is mostly good for creating stress and
anxiety.

There are a few things I still can’t do with my hands, but they’re
things I rarely do anyway, like using a scissors for over 10 minutes.
